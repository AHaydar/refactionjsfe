# JavaScript exercise
The exercise is to clean up this code and put it in a sensible structure, using the best of idiomatic ES, modern libraries, and frameworks possible. The application runs correctly, but there's a lot of duplication and tangling of concerns, the rendering is all server-side, and its filtering use case is limited.

## Installation
Please follow the below instructions to install and start the application on your local:
* Navigate to the backend folder and run: `npm i` - This will start the graphql server on http://localhost:4000
* Navigate to the front-end folder and run: `npm i`. browse to http://localhost:3000
